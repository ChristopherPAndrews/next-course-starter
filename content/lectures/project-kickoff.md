* Review the project guide online (this is the go-to source of information for
  the project)
* Today is the first sprint planning. You have a mix of administrative and
  development tasks. 
    * Resist the temptation to brainstorm broadly. Keep the Mona Lisa example
      in mind, do *just enough* high-level design (outline of a woman in a
      pastoral setting), but focus on your main features, i.e. the face.
    * Work to define your first sprint goal early in the meeting, then refine
      as you design and have a better estimate of the tasks. Start with the
      nouns and then see if you can start designing the verbs independently.
    * It will be easy to spend the first sprint just planning or designing as a
      group. Get developing. You should have real features to show in the first
      demo in two weeks.
* Your first deliverable is on Thursday (getting your infrastructure setup). If
  you haven't clicked through the GitHub classroom link, do so ASAP.
